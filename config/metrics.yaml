# Metrics registry for evidence-ready AI evaluations.

metrics:
  - name: outcome_quality_score
    description: >
      Scalar score summarising the quality of the AI-assisted outcome for a task
      (e.g., correctness, usefulness), here generated synthetically.
    type: continuous
    direction: higher_is_better
    table: fact_interactions
    field: outcome_quality_score

  - name: resolution_time_sec
    description: >
      Time between task creation and resolution, in seconds.
    type: continuous
    direction: lower_is_better
    table: fact_tasks
    field: resolution_time_sec

  - name: escalation_rate
    description: >
      Fraction of interactions with action_type = 'escalate' for a given slice.
    type: rate
    direction: lower_is_better
    derived_from:
      table: fact_interactions
      numerator_condition: action_type == "escalate"
      denominator: count_rows

  - name: accept_rate
    description: >
      Fraction of interactions with action_type = 'accept' for a given slice.
    type: rate
    direction: higher_is_better
    derived_from:
      table: fact_interactions
      numerator_condition: action_type == "accept"
      denominator: count_rows
