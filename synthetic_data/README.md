# Synthetic datasets

This directory contains synthetic datasets that follow the schema defined in
`schema/tables_schema.sql`. They are generated by `generate_synthetic_data.py`
and include:

- `dim_users.csv`
- `dim_teams.csv`
- `dim_experiments.csv`
- `fact_tasks.csv`
- `fact_interactions.csv`

All data is synthetic and intended for testing queries, dashboards, and example
analyses without exposing real logs.
